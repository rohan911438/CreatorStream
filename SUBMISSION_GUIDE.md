## üéØ Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)

"CreatorStream solves the problem of NFT royalty tracking for digital creators. 

Currently, creators manually track payments across multiple marketplaces like NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day - it's time-consuming and error-prone.

Our solution uses Flow blockchain to automatically record every royalty payment on-chain, provides real-time analytics, and enables transparent revenue splits among collaborators.

Built with Cadence smart contracts and Dapper Wallet integration, CreatorStream ensures every payment is verified, transparent, and immutable.

We've deployed a fully working contract with 4 successful test transactions, demonstrating royalty recording, split creation, and data querying.

Perfect for Flow's NFT ecosystem - where creators deserve better tools."

## üéØ Judge Questions - Prepared Answers

**Q: Why Flow over other blockchains?**
A: Flow is purpose-built for NFTs. With Dapper Wallet having 1M+ NBA Top Shot users, it's the perfect ecosystem for creator tools. Plus Cadence's resource model ensures safety.

**Q: How do you get royalty data?**
A: Currently manual input (MVP). Phase 2 integrates with marketplace APIs. The value is in on-chain verification and automated splits.

**Q: What about gas fees?**
A: Flow's low fees make micro-transactions viable. Creators pay pennies to record payments worth dollars.

**Q: Competitor analysis?**
A: No other Flow-native royalty tracker exists. Existing tools are spreadsheets or multi-chain platforms that don't leverage Flow's strengths.

**Q: Business model?**
A: Freemium: Basic free, Premium features (API access, advanced analytics) for power users. Potential marketplace revenue sharing.

**Q: What's next?**
A: 1) Deploy to testnet, 2) NBA Top Shot API integration, 3) Automated payout execution, 4) Mobile app.

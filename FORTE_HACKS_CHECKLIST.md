## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL JUDGE QUESTIONS

**Q: Why Flow blockchain?**
A: Flow is purpose-built for NFTs with Dapper Wallet integration, making it perfect for creator royalty tracking on marketplaces like NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day.

**Q: Is this deployed on testnet/mainnet?**
A: Currently on emulator for demo. Can deploy to testnet/mainnet in minutes. (Deploy before submission if required!)

**Q: How do royalties get tracked?**
A: Creators manually record royalties (can be automated via marketplace APIs in production). All data is stored on-chain for transparency.

**Q: What makes this different from manual tracking?**
A: On-chain verification, automatic split calculations, real-time analytics, and transparent audit trail.

**Q: Can this work with other blockchains?**
A: Designed specifically for Flow's NFT ecosystem, but architecture is adaptable.
